# macher-instruct

This is a fork of the Emacs package
[evedel](https://github.com/daedsidog/evedel) which is unfortunately no longer
maintained.

`macher-instruct` aims to make `evedel`'s overlay functionality and workflow
available to the `macher` [macher](https://github.com/kmontag/macher) package.
