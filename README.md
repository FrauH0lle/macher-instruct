# mevedel

**mevedel is macher plus evedel**

This is a fork of the Emacs package
[evedel](https://github.com/daedsidog/evedel) which is unfortunately no longer
maintained.

`mevedel` aims to make `evedel`'s overlay functionality and workflow
available to the [macher](https://github.com/kmontag/macher) package.

> [!WARNING]  
> The package is functional but still work in progress. Expect missing features, unexpected behavior and bugs.

## What does this package do?

This README is not completed yet, so I have to refer you to [evedel's documentation](https://github.com/daedsidog/evedel). 
As this is a direct fork, you can access the same options and commands simply by replacing the `evedel-` prefix with `mevedel`.

Below is a fairly simple demonstration on how this works. The overlay actions can be accessed by pressing `RET` when insinde one. 
The options should be self-explanatory.
